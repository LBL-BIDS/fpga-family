The intent of this directory is to hold wrappers for the device-dependent
features of specific FPGA.  Known features that should land here:
 - DDR output cells
 - DDR input cells
 - JTAG access
 - High speed serial (MGT, GTP, ...)
 - Clock handling?

This is almost the same idea as the resources held in peripheral_drivers,
but:
 - There's (almost) no code here, just a shim to the device-specific
    hard-core instantiation
 - This group gets to be sorted by fpga family, since you would never
    mix-and-match, one synthesis has to target a specific chip within
    a family.
 - It is considered difficult and/or useless to simulate and test the
    code, since it by itself does almost nothing.

Assuming we have consistent interfaces across families, an application
  that uses that interface can be easily switched to a board with a
  different chip family.
